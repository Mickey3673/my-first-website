    <h2><b>About me</b></h2>
    <p>My name is Mike Machuma I am 19 years old.I finished my high school last year from Testimony High school.
      I am currently a student at Moringa school currently learning on how to code and program,I developed an intrest in computers since I was a young boy
       I decided to  study programming because technology is growing so fast and the orld needs more developers to solve global problems through technology.
       Technology has helped diversify many entities and has made the human life easy and more efficient with less effort and saves time.
       I love art as well as touring new places and experiencing new cultural experiences.
